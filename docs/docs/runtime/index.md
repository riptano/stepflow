# Runtime

The StepFlow runtime is responsible for executing workflows.
Depending on your needs, you can [run a single workflow](../cli.md#run), [launch a workflow server](../cli.md#serve), or [submit a workflow to a server](../cli.md#submit).

* [Commands](../cli.md) has details on the StepFlow command-line and how to do each of those, as well as the available options.
* [Config](../config.md) discusses how to configure the StepFlow and the available plugins and components.
