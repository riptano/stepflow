# Methods Reference

The Stepflow Protocol defines methods and notifications for communication between the runtime and component servers. This reference provides a complete overview of all available methods organized by category.

## Method Categories

The protocol methods are organized into four main categories:

1. **[Initialization](./initialization.md)** - Protocol connection and capability negotiation
2. **[Components](./components.md)** - Component discovery, introspection, and execution
3. **[Blob Storage](./blobs.md)** - Content-addressable data storage and retrieval
4. **[Flows](./flows.md)** - Workflow expression evaluation and context access

## Complete Method Reference

| Method | Direction | Type | Description |
|--------|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Initialization** | | | |
| [`initialize`](./initialization.md#initialize-method) | Runtime → Component | Request | Negotiate protocol version and establish capabilities |
| [`initialized`](./initialization.md#initialized-notification) | Runtime → Component | Notification | Confirm initialization is complete |
| **Components** | | | |
| [`components/list`](./components.md#componentslist-method) | Runtime → Component | Request | Discover all available components |
| [`components/info`](./components.md#componentsinfo-method) | Runtime → Component | Request | Get detailed component information and schema |
| [`components/execute`](./components.md#componentsexecute-method) | Runtime → Component | Request | Execute a component with input data |
| **Blob Storage** | | | |
| [`blobs/put`](./blobs.md#blobsput-method) | Component → Runtime | Request | Store JSON data and receive content-addressable ID |
| [`blobs/get`](./blobs.md#blobsget-method) | Component → Runtime | Request | Retrieve data by blob ID |
| **Flows** | | | |
| [`flows/evaluate`](./flows.md#flowsevaluate-method) | Component → Runtime | Request | Evaluate workflow expressions in runtime context |
