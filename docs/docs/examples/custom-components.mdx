## Next Steps

Custom components are the key to extending Stepflow's capabilities:

- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic data processing components
- **Choose Transport**: Use STDIO for simple local components, HTTP for distributed systems
- **Add Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and retry logic
- **Optimize Performance**: Use async/await and parallel processing for scalability
- **Test Thoroughly**: Write comprehensive unit and integration tests
- **Document Well**: Provide clear schemas and usage examples
- **Scale Appropriately**: Use HTTP transport for microservices and distributed deployments
