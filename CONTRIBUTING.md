## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Rust 1.70+** - Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- **Python 3.8+** - For Python SDK development and examples
- **uv** - Python package manager (install via `pip install uv`)

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/riptano/stepflow.git
   cd stepflow
   ```

2. **Build the stepflow-rs project**
   ```bash
   cd stepflow-rs
   cargo build
   ```

3. **Run tests to verify setup**
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

4. **Try running an example**
   ```bash
   cargo run -- run --flow=examples/python/basic.yaml --input=examples/python/input1.json
   ```

## Building and Testing

### Building

```bash
# Build the entire project (run from stepflow-rs directory)
cd stepflow-rs
cargo build

# Build with release optimizations
cargo build --release
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests (run from stepflow-rs directory)
cd stepflow-rs
cargo test

# Run with snapshot testing (preferred for development)
cargo insta test --unreferenced=delete --review

# Run tests for a specific crate
cargo test -p stepflow-execution

# Run a specific test
cargo test -p stepflow-execution -- execute_flows
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Run clippy for linting (run from stepflow-rs directory)
cd stepflow-rs
cargo clippy

# Auto-fix linting issues where possible
cargo clippy --fix

# Format code
cargo fmt

# Auto-fix unused dependencies
cargo machete --fix --with-metadata
```

**Important**: Always run `cargo clippy` and `cargo fmt` before submitting changes.

## Project Architecture

### Repository Structure

This repository contains multiple components:

- **`stepflow-rs/`** - Main Rust-based execution engine and runtime
- **`stepflow-ui/`** - Web-based frontend for workflow management
- **`sdks/python/`** (`stepflow-py`) - Python SDK for building components
- **`sdks/typescript/`** (`stepflow-ts`) - TypeScript SDK for building components

### Rust Workspace

The main `stepflow-rs/` directory contains a Rust workspace with multiple crates:

### Core Crates

- **`stepflow-core`** - Core types and workflow definitions
- **`stepflow-execution`** - Workflow execution engine
- **`stepflow-plugin`** - Plugin system and trait definitions
- **`stepflow-protocol`** - JSON-RPC communication protocol
- **`stepflow-builtins`** - Built-in component implementations
- **`stepflow-components-mcp`** - MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration
- **`stepflow-main`** - CLI binary and service implementation
- **`stepflow-mock`** - Mock implementations for testing

### Key Concepts

- **Flow**: Complete workflow definition with steps, inputs, and outputs
- **Step**: Single operation within a workflow
- **Component**: Specific implementation that a step invokes
- **Plugin**: Service providing one or more components
- **Value**: Data flowing between steps with references

### Error Handling

StepFlow uses two distinct error types:

1. **Flow Errors** (`FlowError`): Business logic failures that are part of normal workflow execution
2. **System Errors** (`Result::Err`): Implementation or infrastructure failures

See `CLAUDE.md` for detailed architecture information.

## Code Style and Conventions

### Rust Code Standards

- **Formatting**: Use `rustfmt` (run `cargo fmt`)
- **Linting**: Use `clippy` (run `cargo clippy`)
- **Line length**: Maximum 100 characters
- **API Guidelines**: Follow [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/)

### Documentation

- Use `///` for public API documentation
- Use `//!` for module-level documentation
- Include examples in documentation where appropriate
- Document all public types, functions, and traits
- Use markdown in documentation comments

### Error Handling

- Define custom error types in `error.rs` modules
- Use `thiserror` for defining error types
- Include context in error messages
- Document error variants and their meanings
- Include `type Result<T, E = TheErrorType>` aliases

### Testing

- Place unit tests in the same file as the code they test
- Use `#[cfg(test)]` for test modules
- Follow the pattern: `mod tests { ... }`
- Place integration tests in the `tests/` directory
- Test both success and failure cases

### Logging and Tracing

- Use the `tracing` package for all logging and instrumentation
- Use appropriate log levels (error, warn, info, debug, trace)
- Include relevant context in log messages
- Use structured logging where appropriate
- Use spans for tracking operation context
- Use events for discrete log messages

## Making Contributions

### Types of Contributions

We welcome various types of contributions:

- **Bug fixes** - Fix existing issues
- **New features** - Add new functionality
- **Documentation** - Improve docs, examples, or comments
- **Performance** - Optimize existing code
- **Testing** - Add or improve tests
- **Examples** - Create new workflow examples

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** - Look for related issues or discussions
2. **Create an issue** - For significant changes, create an issue first to discuss the approach
3. **Fork the repository** - Create your own fork to work in

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write code following our conventions
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   cd stepflow-rs
   cargo test
   cargo clippy
   cargo fmt --check
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Commit Message Format

Use conventional commit prefixes:

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Formatting changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or modifying tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

**Format**: `type: description`

**Example**: `feat: add support for HTTP-based plugins`

## Development Tips

### Common Commands

```bash
# Quick development cycle
cargo check          # Fast syntax check
cargo test            # Run tests
cargo clippy          # Check for issues
cargo fmt             # Format code

# Working with examples (run from stepflow-rs directory)
cd stepflow-rs
cargo run -- run --flow=examples/python/basic.yaml --input=examples/python/input1.json

# Debugging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run -- run --flow=your-flow.yaml --input=your-input.json
```

### IDE Setup

For VS Code users, we recommend:

- `rust-analyzer` extension
- `Better TOML` extension
- Configure format-on-save for consistent formatting
