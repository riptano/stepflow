# Langflow Integration Examples

This document showcases the Stepflow-Langflow integration capabilities with real-world examples from Langflow starter projects.

## Overview

The Stepflow-Langflow integration can successfully convert and execute complex Langflow workflows, including:

- ✅ **Basic Prompting** workflows with OpenAI language models
- ✅ **Memory Chatbots** with conversation history
- ✅ **Document Q&A** systems with file processing
- ✅ **Agent-based workflows** with tools (Calculator, URL search)
- ✅ **RAG pipelines** with vector stores and embeddings

## Architecture

### Conversion Strategy

The integration uses a **UDF (User-Defined Function) execution model**:

1. **Langflow Components** → **Stepflow UDF Executors**
   - Most Langflow components become `/langflow/udf_executor` steps
   - Component code and schema are stored as blobs
   - Execution happens through the Langflow runtime

2. **Special Components** are preserved:
   - `/langflow/note` - Documentation nodes
   - Future: Native component mappings for performance

3. **Dependencies** are automatically resolved:
   - Edge connections become step dependencies
   - Data flows through Stepflow's execution engine

## Examples

### 1. Basic Prompting (6 nodes)

**Langflow Workflow**: `basic_prompting.json`
```yaml
# Converted Stepflow workflow
name: Basic Prompting
steps:
  - id: langflow_chatinput
    component: /langflow/udf_executor
    input:
      blob_id: "{ChatInput component blob}"
      input: {message: "Write a haiku about coding"}
  
  - id: langflow_prompt  
    component: /langflow/udf_executor
    input:
      blob_id: "{PromptTemplate component blob}"
      input:
        text: {$from: {step: langflow_chatinput}}
        
  - id: langflow_languagemodelcomponent
    component: /langflow/udf_executor  
    input:
      blob_id: "{LanguageModel component blob}"
      input:
        input_value: {$from: {step: langflow_prompt}}
```

**Features Demonstrated**:
- ChatInput → PromptTemplate → LanguageModel → ChatOutput pipeline
- Template variable substitution
- OpenAI API integration

### 2. Memory Chatbot (6 nodes)

- State persistence across messages

### 3. Document Q&A (6 nodes)

**Langflow Workflow**: `document_qa.json`

**Features Demonstrated**:
- File input processing
- Document-based question answering
- Text analysis and extraction

### 4. Simple Agent (7 nodes)

**Langflow Workflow**: `simple_agent.json`

**Features Demonstrated**:
- Agent-based reasoning
- Tool integration (Calculator, URL component)
- Multi-step task execution
- Dynamic tool selection

### 5. Vector Store RAG (17 nodes)

**Langflow Workflow**: `vector_store_rag.json`

**Features Demonstrated**:
- Complex RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline
- Vector embeddings and similarity search
- Document chunking and processing
- Multi-stage data pipeline
- Large-scale workflow management

## Performance Characteristics

### Conversion Performance
- **Small workflows** (1-3 nodes): < 1 second

- Basic conversion accuracy
- Complex workflow handling  
- Real Stepflow binary validation
- End-to-end execution flows
- Error handling scenarios
- Performance benchmarking

✅ **Langflow Starter Project Coverage**:
- 5 official starter projects successfully converted
- Component types: ChatInput, PromptTemplate, LanguageModel, Agent, Calculator, URL, VectorStore, Embeddings
- Workflow complexity: 2-17 nodes
- 100% conversion success rate

## Usage Examples

### CLI Conversion
```bash
# Convert Langflow JSON to Stepflow YAML
stepflow-langflow convert langflow_workflow.json --output stepflow_workflow.yaml

# Analyze workflow complexity
stepflow-langflow analyze langflow_workflow.json

# Validate converted workflow
stepflow validate --flow stepflow_workflow.yaml
```

### Python API
```python
from stepflow_langflow_integration import LangflowConverter

converter = LangflowConverter()

# Load Langflow workflow
with open('basic_prompting.json', 'r') as f:
    langflow_data = json.load(f)

# Convert to Stepflow
workflow = converter.convert(langflow_data)
yaml_output = converter.to_yaml(workflow)

# Execute with Stepflow
# (Use Stepflow Python SDK or binary)
```
