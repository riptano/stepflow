  "initial_context": "The Model Context Protocol (MCP) represents a standardized approach to connecting AI systems with external tools and services. In the context of workflow orchestration, MCP enables seamless integration of filesystem operations, database access, API calls, and other tool interactions within AI pipelines. This protocol is particularly valuable when combined with LLM-powered workflows, as it allows AI components to not just process information but also take actions in the real world. For example, a research assistant workflow can use LangChain for content analysis and generation, while leveraging MCP for reading source documents, writing reports, and organizing output files. The protocol's strength lies in its simplicity and extensibility - new tools can be added as MCP servers without modifying the core workflow engine. This architectural pattern promotes loose coupling, reusability, and scalability in AI application development.",
